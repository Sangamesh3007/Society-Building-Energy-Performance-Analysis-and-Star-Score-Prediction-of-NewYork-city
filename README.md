# Society-Building-Energy-Performance-Analysis-and-Star-Score-Prediction-of-NewYork-city
### Final Project on Machine Learning
<br>
An implementation of a complete machine learning solution in Python on a real-world dataset
<br>
In this project, we aim to explore the relationships within a dataset comprising 11,746 rows and 60 features, with a focus on understanding factors influencing the Energy Star score for buildings in New York. The dataset combines categorical and numerical features, presenting a diverse set of variables. Rigorous preprocessing, including null value and outlier treatments, was followed by one-hot encoding and standardization.
<br>
Employing Multiple Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest Regressor, and SVR models, the project evaluates and selects the most accurate model using R-squared values. The results aim to uncover factors influencing energy performance and predict scores for buildings without Energy Star ratings, contributing to informed urban development decisions.
